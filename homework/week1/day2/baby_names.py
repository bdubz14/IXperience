In this example we are going to build an application that reads the most popular names
in the US, taken from the Social Security Administration's site:

https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/

This application will have the following functionalities:

- It will accept a name as an argument
- It will read a list of files (located in the folder data). Each file contains the
most popular baby names for boys and girls for a certain year (the year is in the filename)
- For the name provided as an argument, print out how many years it's been among the most popular among boys and girls
